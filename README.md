# Java ATM

Java ATM is a command-line based ATM program written in Java. It simulates the functionality of a real-life ATM, allowing users to deposit, withdraw and check their account balance. The focus of this project was to create an interface that was seamlessly traversable similarly to a real ATM.

## Features

- Deposit
- Withdraw
- Check account balance


## Requirements

- Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- A Java IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh 
$ git clone https://github.com/RyanMcGrath1/ATM.git

```

2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.

3. Run the program from your IDE.

## Usage

Upon running the program, the user will be brought to the main menu. The user will be given options to deposit, withdraw, check their account balance, or exit the program. The starting balance in the account is set to zero, so a deposit must be made first in order to make a withdrawal.
